All themes share the same content, they differ only in presentation. Your current theme is stored in a cookie, which is updated by specifying a \"version=VERSION\" query parameter in any url. Of course, all versions of the site require a web browser to access, so if you don't have that (well first of all, how'd you find this site?), feel free to just SSH into the server and read the files directly!"
